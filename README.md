# password-generator

An application that generates a random password based on user-selected criteria.

## Description

User will be prompted with selectiing the character length, and character set(s) for the password they desire. Then display That password in an alert.

## Getting Started

Just go to https://frantzcfelix.github.io/password-generator/ and the user will be prompted for the password length and criteria immediately.


### Executing program

* Go to a web browser(use chrome please).
* Type in https://frantzcfelix.github.io/password-generator/
* Hit enter.
* Give a value of any number between 8 and 128 for the length of your password,
* Enter a value of 's' for special characters, 'n' for numerical characters, 'l' for lowercase characters, 'u' for uppercase characters or any combination of them, as long as you pick atleast 1.
* The password generated will display in an alert.


## Help
Some issues my code currently has:
* Hitting cancel on the prompts does not exit the loop as desired.
* A very small chance ther user may not get a password with every character from the users criteria. This chance goes down as password length increases.
* Did too much back and forth between strings and arrays. Could just keep all of my char sets and password varaiables as strings.
